## Overview of Election Results
The purpose of this challenge was to conduct an audit of the election results and then provide them to the election commission. The commission requested data to be provided breaking down the votes for each county and candidate. Provided to them would be a breakdown of the total number of votes and percentage of total votes for each candidate as well as the votes casted for each candidate. The data would then help us determine the candidate who won the election as well as the county who had the largest voter turnout.
